Design
=========================

###Summary
Meerkat itself is built using various open-source technologies, none of which are pertinent to the design or implementation of the web service layer.
The primary design goal is to provide a structured interface for any number of internal customers who may wish to incorporate user context, geo-location, or transaction categorization into their offerings.

##Future Roadmap
*  To be determined
