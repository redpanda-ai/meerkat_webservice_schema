Design
=========================

###Summary
Meerkat itself is built using various open-source technologies, none of which are pertinent to the design or implementation of the web service layer.
The primary goal here is to design a structured method for interacting with Meerkat as a web service, describe how to connect to, properly use, and troubleshoot the web service.  Also, this project repository provides a secure method to track all questions and design decisions as the web service evolves.

##Future Roadmap
*  To be determined
