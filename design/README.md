Design
=========================

The design of the Meerkat Web Service API is rather straightforward.  I will add details soon.

###Summary
Meerkat itself is built using various open-source technologies, but the web-service is the contract through which it makes categorization and geo-location available to the rest of our organization.

##Goals
*  Provide an internal web service API that can integrate with
  *  Yodlee Interactive
  *  Yodlee's main platform
  *  Yodlee's data warehouse

##Future Roadmap
*  To be determined
